      <h5>Gameplay</h5>
      <p>
        Hollow knight is a metroidvania style game. This means that the player traverses through a large world, starting with little-to-no capabilities and powerups, and gains new powers as they progress which open up new paths and opportunities.
      </p>
      <h5>Setting</h5>
      <p>
        Hollow Knight takes place in the land of Hollownest. This is a land whose inhabitants are all bug-like creatures. The land is being overrun by an infection, causing most citizens to either die or become corrupt.
      </p>
      <h5>Characters</h5>
      <p>
        Throughout the world, the player comes to meet a variety of characters that vary from shopkeepers to friends that assist in battle.
      </p>
      <h5>Combat</h5>
      <p>
        Hollow knight contains a very large variety of enemies to fight and conquer. This includes over 40 different unique bosses.
      </p>

      <h3>Character Upgrades</h3>
        <h5>Mothwing Cloak:</h5>
        <p>
          The Mothwing Cloak is the first movement upgrade that the Knight aquires on it's journey. The cloak allows the user to dash forward a short distance. This allows the player to cross distances that were previously impossible to conquer.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Mantis Claw:</h5>
        <p>
          The mantis claw is a very useful movement upgrade. The knight is able to dig the claw into walls and then jump off of them. This allows the player to reach new heights by climbing up walls.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Crystal Heart:</h5>
        <p>
          Crystal Heart is an upgrade which is very situational. When using this ability, the knight first charges up while standing still, then the player shoots forward at a very rapid pace, flying through the air. This allows the player to cross extremely long distances, but only with a little preperation.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Monarch Wings:</h5>
        <p>
          The Monarch Wings are a very powerful upgrade for the knight. The wings allow the player to jump a 2nd time in the air. This gives the player a very large amount of freedom and versitility while traversing the world and fighting enemies.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Ismas's Tear:</h5>
        <p>
          Isma's Tear is a unique upgrade for the knight because it doesn't change the player's movement at all. The tear allows the knight to swim in the poisonous water that is scattered around Hollownest.        </p>
        
        <h5>Shade Cloak:</h5>
        <p>
          The Shade Cloak is an upgrade to the Mothwing Cloak. It allows the player to dash through shadow barriers, unlocking many areas in the world. It also allows the player to dash through enemies, which is very helpful in combat.        </p>

      <h3>Weapon Upgrades</h3>
      <h5>The Nail:</h5>
      <p>
        The nail is the basic attack of the knight. It is a melee weapon which can be swung in any of the four directions. The nail can be upgraded 4 times using Pale Ore which is found throughout the game. Each nail upgrade causes it to do increased damage.
      </p>
      
      <h5>Vengeful Spirit:</h5>
      <p>
        Vengeful Spirit is the first spell that you aquire on your journey. The ability costs 33 soul to cast, and shoots a fireball-like projectile across the screen.
      </p>
      
      <h5>Howling Wraiths:</h5>
      <p>
        Howling Wraiths is a very powerful spell which does a large amount of damage. The ability costs 33 soul to cast, and fires a large projectile directly above the knight's head which hits enemies multiple times.
      </p>
      
      <h5>Desolate Dive:</h5>
          <p>
          Desolate Dive is one of the strongest spells in the game. The ability costs 33 soul to cast, and it slams the user down into the ground. As the knight is falling it is immune to damage, which makes it very useful for staying alive in sticky situations.
