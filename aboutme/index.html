    Hello! My name is Jonathan Oliphant. This is my second semester attending BYU-I
    and I am an on-campus student. I am studying computer science. I have an intermediate background
    in computer science from some classes I took in grade school and learning from my dad. I'm super
    excited to learn more about HTML and CSS.

    I love anything and everything music! I have sang my whole life and am currently in the men's chorus.
    I also play the piano! I started when I was about 8 and played off-and-on up until a few months ago
    when I really started putting the effort into it. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I also love pretty much all sports! I especially love Volleyball, Ultimate Frisbee and soccer!
    I played Soccer in High school, and I just love playing volleyball even though I don't do it much.
